## A SLM for Linux (Reference repository)

Why should you use a SLM in your OS? What about two? Or three? Image having your personal Alexa, what about having a personal assitant or a coworkers you can use to handle with different task. Sounds great, right? Let's imagen something like that completly native for your GNU/Linux OS, useful for you and customized by you, to make it just as you need it, to solve your particular issues under your own context. That's the goal of this paper

## TODO

- [ ] Create methodology 
- [ ] Analize option
- [ ] Change arch overview 

## State of the art

#### Native support

- [Deepin Assistant](https://www.deepin.org/zh/original/deepin-presentation-assistant/) is currently on development (Chinese reference), but it's based on LLM of Google AI
- [Athena](https://github.com/athena-team/athena) still on development, might be something similar
- [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) can control a computer from a cellphone (Not really relate to Virtual Assistant)

#### Non supported or Partial support
- [Amazon Alex](https://www.linuxadictos.com/alexa-asistente-virtual-linux.html) can be used under wine or any Android Emulator
- [Google assistant](https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/113897415/is-google-assistant-available-for-linux-os?hl=en) isn't really available for Linux as with Native support [Last Update - Jun 17, 2021]
